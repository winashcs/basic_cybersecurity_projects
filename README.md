# basic_cybersecurity_projects
This repository contains basic projects related to cybersecurity which is made using python language.

**encryption.py**<br>
This program serves as an introductory example for understanding encryption techniques and basic programming concepts within the realm of cybersecurity. It offers a hands-on approach to explore encryption and decryption processes.Encryption and decryption are vital for safeguarding sensitive information, preventing unauthorized access, ensuring privacy, and maintaining data integrity in digital communications, transactions, and storage systems, enhancing cybersecurity and protecting against threats such as data breaches, identity theft, and espionage.This Python program demonstrates a basic encryption and decryption process using a substitution cipher. It prompts users to input a message to encrypt or decrypt. During encryption, each character in the plaintext is substituted with a corresponding character from a shuffled key while decryption reverses this process.

**keylogger.py**<br>
Keyloggers are used to record your keystroke.In this program we create a text file "record", which will keep the track of the keystroke you type everytime you run the program and it will stop tracking when you press the escape button on your keyboard. The purpose of this program is to understand the basic concept of keylogger. We can use this program ethically to keep parental control so as to monitor the child's activity on internet. We need to be aware that in some of the cybercaf√©s this type of program will be already installed in the system and will record every keystroke and append it in the "record" file in a hidden folder within the same system.

**password_generator.py**<br>
In today's world almost everything is digitalized and to secure our digital activites we require strong passwords. In this program we take the input from user asking for the length of the password and accordingly it will generate a password which may contains digits,upper case-lower case letters as well as special characters of the given length. This combination can create the strongest password for the user which will be difficult for the hackers to implement password-cracking process onto this password. The purpose of this program is to understand the importance of  generating strong passwords and avoid common pitfalls like using easily guessable passwords or reusing passwords across multiple accounts. Password generators contribute to building a more security-conscious culture.

**password_validator.py**<br>
A password validator helps to assess the strength of the password entered by user on predefined criteria. In this program we ask the user to input the password. If we find that password is weak we tell the user to make the necessary changes. First we check if the length of the password is greater than eight. Once that condition is satisfied we check if the password has at least one upper,lower,digit and special symbols. If the password passes all the tests then we tell the user that the password validation is successfull which means the password is strong enough. The purpose of this program is to educate the user to build strong password so as to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

**screen_rotating_virus.py**<br>
In this program we created a malware that can rotate the device's screen continuously. The main purpose of this malware is used to create loss of productive time and annoyance. This malware also can be a tactic to distract the user from other malicious activities taking place on the device. Hackers can use this malware along with social engineering by immediately calling the user as tech-support thus making him reveal senesitive information so as to fix this issue. The purpose of this program is to educate the user in understanding the various concepts involved in cybersecurity like social engineering and malware.

**website_blocker.py**<br>
In this program we open the host file in read and write mode. It first reads the file by checking if the given website website names are already present or not. If it is not present it will add the website name to its list to block that website. The purpose of a website blocker is to regulate and control access to certain websites or categories of websites on the internet. We can use this program mainly to keep parental control so as to prevent the expose of the child to inappropriate website.

In conclusion, our basic cybersecurity project represents a foundational journey into the intricacies of digital protection. From the implementation of encryption.py for secure message transmission to the development of keylogger.py for understanding malware risks, each component has contributed to our holistic understanding of cybersecurity essentials. The creation of password_generator.py and password_validator.py has empowered us to establish robust password management practices, while our exploration of screen_rotating_virus.py underscored the disruptive potential of malicious software, emphasizing the need for resilient defense mechanisms. Furthermore, the proactive measures introduced through website_blocker.py have demonstrated our commitment to controlling our online environment and mitigating potential threats. As we wrap up this project, we emerge equipped with invaluable hands-on experience and a deeper appreciation for the critical role of cybersecurity in safeguarding digital assets and privacy. This endeavor serves as a pivotal starting point for our ongoing journey towards enhancing our cybersecurity expertise and ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of our digital interactions in an ever-evolving landscape of digital threats.
