# basic_cybersecurity_projects
This repository contains basic projects related to cybersecurity which is made using python language.

1.keylogger.py
Keyloggers are used to record your keystroke.In this program we create a text file "record", which will keep the track of the keystroke you type everytime you run the program and it will stop tracking when you press the escape button on your keyboard. The purpose of this program is to understand the basic concept of keylogger. We can use this program ethically to keep parental control so as to monitor the child's activity on internet. We need to be aware that in some of the cybercaf√© this type of program will be already installed in the system and will record every keystroke and append it in the "record" file in a hidden folder with in the same system.

2.password_generator.py
In today's world almost everything is digitalized and to secure our digital activites we require strong passwords. In this program we take the input from user asking for the length of the password and accordingly it will generate a password which may contains digits,upper case-lower case letters as well as special characters of the given length. This combination can create the strongest password for the user which will be difficult for the hackers to implement password-cracking process onto this password. The purpose of this program is to understand the importance of  generating strong passwords and avoid common pitfalls like using easily guessable passwords or reusing passwords across multiple accounts. Password generators contribute to building a more security-conscious culture.

3.password_validator.py
A password validator helps to assess the strength of the password entered by user on predefined criteria. In this program we ask the user to input the password. If we find that password is weak we tell the user to make the necessary changes. First we check if the length of the password is greater than eight. Once that condition is satisfied we check if the password has at least one upper,lower,digit and special symbols. If the password passes all the tests then we tell the user that the password validation is successfull which means the password is strong enough. The purpose of this program is to educate the user to build strong password so as to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

4.screen_rotating_virus.py
In this program we created a malware that can rotate the device's screen continuously. The main purpose of this malware is used to create loss of productive time and annoyance. This malware also can be a tactic to distract the user from other malicious activities taking place on the device. Hackers can use this malware along with social engineering by immediately calling the user as tech-support thus making him reveal senesitive information so as to fix this issue. The purpose of this program is to educate the user in understanding the various concepts involved in cybersecurity like social engineering and malware.

5.website_blocker.py
In this program we open the host file in read and write mode. It first reads the file by checking if the given website website names are already present or not. If it is not present it will add the website name to its list to block that website. The purpose of a website blocker is to regulate and control access to certain websites or categories of websites on the internet. We can use this program mainly to keep parental control so as to prevent the expose of the child to inappropriate website.

In wrapping up our basic cybersecurity projects, we've gained valuable hands-on experience in essential aspects of digital protection. From creating secure passwords with our password generator to ensuring their strength with our password validator, we've learned how to defend against unauthorized access. Additionally, by developing a keylogger, we've understood the potential risks of malware and the importance of safeguarding against it. Our exploration into the screen_rotating_virus underscored the disruptive nature of malicious software, highlighting the necessity for robust defense mechanisms. Finally, with our website blocker, we've taken proactive steps to control our online environment and mitigate potential threats. As we conclude these projects, we carry forward a deeper understanding of cybersecurity fundamentals, equipped to navigate and secure our digital world effectively.
